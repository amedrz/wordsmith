## Read, Read, Read

I read, and read, and read. During bus rides to and from one destination 
to another. Before I sleep at night. Whenever I'm waiting for 
an activity to happen. You will always find a book in my bag - and yes, 
I am a "bag man". Nothing triggers good writing better than good reads.

I'm a keen observer of my environment, the people surrounding me, 
and the unique situations that I find myself in constantly. They provide fodder 
to my literary outputs, planting the seeds of the narratives that chronicle my thoughts.

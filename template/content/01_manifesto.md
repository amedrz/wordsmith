## A Wordsmith's Manifesto

I eat, pray and love the written word. My every spare moment is spent reading, 
writing, or listening to words that bring inspiration, comfort, wisdom and joy. 

I am always poised to pen something down, especially when triggered by 
a flash of insight, moved by a scene, or teased by an idea that refuses 
to leave my head. 

I carry a notepad and pen with me whenever I go for meetings, regardless of 
the agenda. Capturing prodigious quantities of notes is always a good practice 
for the inner journalist in me.

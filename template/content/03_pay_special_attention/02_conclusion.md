### There is a time and place for everything

I am always mindful of the contexts of my writing. There is a time and place 
for everything under the Sun. Finding the right moment to tell the right story 
to the right audience under the right conditions are crucial elements of writing 
success. Anything else is a compromise.

### I am a Wordsmith

I am always learning and always picking up new things. 
While I trust in my own instincts, I am also painfully aware that I'm not omniscient. 
I will make mistakes, but I will pick myself up again, brush off the dust, and carry on.

I am a wordsmith. Writing is my craft.

## Pay Special Attention

I pay special attention to how every word is crafted and honed 
to meet the page. I fuss over the flow and cadence of my sentences, 
the expressions used, the points highlighted, and how they are 
all assembled together. Especially the beginning and the end. 

### Being human

Being human, however, there will be "off" days when I can barely muster 
a single virtuous word. I understand that good writing isn't as easy 
as turning on a tap and letting it flow. Writer's block is 
an inevitable occupational hazard that hits all of us.

### Different strokes for different folks

I believe in different strokes for different folks. Write for your audiences 
and write for the medium. There are distinct differences between an advertisement, 
a press release, a blog post, an invitation email, a strategy paper, and 
a diary documenting one's innermost thoughts.
